# Before Running

* The code in the Parts where a diagram is required uses the java library which can be found in the lib folder in each Part N folder. I coded it with the lib folder outside of each Part N folder and it compiled correctly but to follow the assignment requirements I needed to move it inside the Part folders. It should run fine if you add the jar inside the lib folder in each Part N directory to the classpath when compiling, but if not then move lib back outside of the Part N folders.

* If running via IDE like VS Code or Cursor then I believe they will automatically add the jar to the classpath and you can run with no configuration.
